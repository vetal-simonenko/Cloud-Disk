# MERN Cloud Disk

In this project, I examined and utilized the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. I built a client-server application comprising both server and client components. The aim was to create a cloud storage system akin to Google Drive. I prioritized functionality over styling, opting for MaterialUI for the interface design.

From inception to completion, I conceptualized and built the application. This involved working extensively with the file system, crafting a basic database layout, developing a REST API, and handling asynchronous requests effectively.

## How To Run

Create the file `server/.env` with your Atlas URI and the server port:

```
DBURL=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@sandbox.jadwj.mongodb.net/
PORT=5000
```

Start server:

```
cd server
npm install
npm	run dev
```

Start Web server

```
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```
